        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I'm interested in working on software that improves the creative process for musicians, and using
          innovative technology to unlock the potential of human creativity.</p>
        <p>I have academic experience in signal processing, music information retrieval, and the Web Audio
          API. I have industrial experience with software development, developer advocacy, and web
          development.</p>
        <p>I'm also interested in Developer Advocacy, particularly if your developer platform enables
          developers to do good.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I've been working in tech for over ten years, and have got a lot done. Here are some highlights.</p>
        <h3>Senior Developer & Developer Advocate at Spotify (2016-Present)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>At Spotify I work as a senior developer on an internal developer productivity platform for
            web developers working on <a href="https://artists.spotify.com">artists.spotify.com</a>.
          </li>
          <li>For a large chunk of my time at Spotify, I worked as a developer advocate. I architected a
            new <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target="_blank">developer.spotify.com</a>,
            represented the company at developer events including hackathons and talks, participated in
            the planning of our developer relations strategy, developed interviews and job descriptions
            for new developer advocates, and worked directly with commercial partners to ensure smooth
            integration of our technology into their product.</li>
          <li>When I first started at Spotify, I spent 9 months working on content ingestion
            infrastructure and tooling, using Java, Python, Javascript (AngularJS and React), and PHP
            (Wordpress and vanilla), working on systems involving RSS and SFTP delivery choreographies
            based on the DDEX standard.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Software Developer at Soundwave (2014-2015)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Worked with backend technologies including Java 8, Jersey 2, Mockito, Powermock, and MongoDB
            to implement the backend that powered Soundwave's consumer facing app.</li>
          <li>Operated as an internal "special projects" developer, on projects including redesigns of
            various websites, developing proofs of concept of new features, and a prototype public API
            for use at Music Hack Day Cannes. I also got to work on HTML5 game development, data science
            using Tableau, and Amazon RedShift, automated social media engagements, and extensive manual
            iOS and Android app testing.</li>
          <li>After completing an internship in the summer of 2014, I was invited to return to Soundwave
            as a junior developer upon completion of my degree. Soundwave was acquired by Spotify in
            January of 2016, and we relocated to Stockholm.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Full Stack Javascript Developer at Playlist.com (2013-2014)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I worked as a web developer at Playlist.com, involved in building an ad-supported internet
            radio website based on the Echo Next music radio API. I worked across the stack, using
            Angular JS 1.0 and Node.JS to serve a UI, and integrate with 3rd party APIs including The
            Echo Nest and Medianet.
